# customer-success-dashboard
An Excel dashboard is one-pager (mostly, but not always necessary) that helps managers and business leaders in tracking key KPIs or metrics and take a decision based on it. It contains charts/tables/views that are backed by data. A dashboard is often called a report, however, not all reports are dashboards.
